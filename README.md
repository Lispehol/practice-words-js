# Vocabulary Practice App
This is a simple desktop application designed to help users practice and improve their vocabulary. The app was initially created to support my son in his language learning journey, but it's open to anyone who wants to expand their vocabulary. The app is still quite clunky and improvements are coming (hopefully) soon.

## Features
- Word Entry: Users can input the words they wish to lear.
- Randomized Translation Practice: The app randomly selects words for translation.
- Simple Interface: The program is easy to use, focusing on learning without unnecessary distractions.
  
## Planned Functionality Improvements
- Improve word entry functionality
- The user sees the result after completing the exercise

## Installation
